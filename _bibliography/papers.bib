  abstract  = {The significant societal impact of online public opinion has spurred extensive research into the underlying mechanisms of information diffusion. While existing diffusion prediction models have effectively leveraged network structure, they often lack a deep understanding of the intrinsic patterns governing information dissemination, thus limiting their predictive power. To address this critical gap, we introduce PMRCA, a novel information diffusion prediction model inspired by social psychology and driven by fundamental propagation patterns. PMRCA posits that two key patterns underpin topic propagation: multisource resonance, where consensus emerges from consistent narratives across multiple sources, and cognitive adaptation, where information is tailored to align with audience cognitive features. Correspondingly, PMRCA incorporates two dedicated learning tasks: structural contrastive learning based on node homogeneity to capture multisource resonance, and clustering contrastive learning based on cognitive clusters to model cognitive adaptation. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that PMRCA significantly outperforms existing mainstream models. Importantly, our pattern-driven approach is model-agnostic, allowing it to be flexibly applied to various diffusion prediction scenarios and enhance performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, some studies have attempted to build foundation models to predict user behavioral intentions across various scenarios. Existing methods typically involve two steps: first, using Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to convert user historical behaviors into semantic vectors; second, capturing latent user intentions through a behavioral sequence encoder. However, limitations still exist in this pipeline. Firstly, most studies directly fix the parameters of PLMs, making it difficult to optimize the generated semantic vectors for specific application scenarios. Even with fine-tuning PLMs considered, the huge model size brings computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a Low-Rank Adaptation technique, which enhances the quality of semantic vectors by training two lightweight low-rank matrices while keeping the original parameters of PLMs frozen. Additionally, the semantic vectors generated by PLMs often exhibit anisotropy, which weakens the expressive power. To address this, we design a parameter whitening expert and a mixed observation expert module to achieve more isotropic semantic representations. Finally, there are significant differences in user behavior patterns across different domains, and such behavioral conflicts can limit the model's generalization ability. Therefore, during the pre-training phase, we introduce multi-domain negative sample fusion and design two contrastive learning tasks. By employing a multi-task learning strategy, we enhance the model's ability to handle multi-domain data. With these improvements, our model achieves stronger adaptability and accuracy in predicting user behavior across different domains.}

  abstract = {This work is inspired by high-definition (HD) image generation techniques. When the user's interests are viewed as different frames of varying clarity, the unclear parts of one interest frame can be clarified by other interest frames. The user's overall HD interest portrait can be viewed as a fusion of multiple interest frames through detail compensation. Based on this inspiration, we propose a model for generating HD interest portrait called interest frame for recommendation (IF4Rec). First, we present a fine-grained pixel-level user interest mining method, Pixel embedding (PE) uses positional coding techniques to mine atomic-level interest pixel matrices in multiple dimensions, such as time, space, and frequency. Then, using an atomic-level interest pixel matrix, we propose Item2Frame to generate several interest frames for a user. The similarity score of each item is calculated to fill the multi-interest pixel clusters, through an improved self-attention mechanism. Finally, stimulated by HD image generation techniques, we initially present an interest frame noise compensation method. By utilizing the multihead attention mechanism, pixel-level optimization and noise complementation are performed between multi-interest frames, and an HD interest portrait is achieved. Experiments show that our model mines users' interests well. On five publicly available datasets, our model outperforms the baselines.}

  abstract = {Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next interactions based on their historical behavior sequences. Traditional approaches primarily focus on time-domain analysis, but often struggle to capture complex temporal patterns and long-term dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel frequency-domain approach to disentangle temporal evolution patterns in sequential recommendation. Our method leverages Fourier transform techniques to decompose user behavior sequences into different frequency components, enabling the model to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dynamics simultaneously. We design a joint learning framework that combines time-domain and frequency-domain representations to enhance recommendation accuracy. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in capturing temporal evolution patterns and improving recommendation quality. The frequency-domain analysis provides new insights into user behavior patterns and offers a promising direction for future sequential recommendation research.}

Traditional approaches primarily focus on network structure analysis, but often overlook the psychological and cognitive factors that drive human information sharing behaviors. In this work, we propose a novel information diffusion prediction model that simultaneously considers multiple propagation intentions and dynamic user cognition patterns. Our model captures how users' cognitive states evolve during information exposure and how different propagation intentions (such as awareness, persuasion, and adoption) interact with these cognitive dynamics. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world social media datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in predicting information diffusion patterns. The model's ability to incorporate psychological insights makes it particularly valuable for understanding complex social phenomena and designing more effective information dissemination strategies.}
