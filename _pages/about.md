I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at **Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)** in Chongqing, China. I am fortunate to be advised by **Prof. Yunpeng Xiao**.

My research interests primarily lie in the fields of **Social Computing**, **Information Diffusion**, and **Information Retrieval**. I am dedicated to developing data-driven approaches to model user behavior and information propagation dynamics within complex social networks. My recent work involves utilizing deep learning and graph mining techniques to address challenges in sequential recommendation, rumor propagation modeling, and multi-source data fusion.

I actively contribute to the academic community and serve as a reviewer or program committee member for several prestigious journals and conferences, including **IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)**, **IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)**, **IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems (TCSS)**, **AAAI** and so on.
